CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project is a clinic management system that helps streamline various tasks involved in managing a medical clinic. It provides functionalities for patient registration, doctor examination, payment processing, statistics, and customizable rules.

Features
Patient Registration: Patients can register for appointments online or at the clinic with a nurse

Doctor Examination: Doctors can create examination forms for patients and access their medical history or lookup relevant medical information.

Payment Processing: Cashiers can handle bill payments for patients, including consultation fees and prescribed medications. The system generates payment invoices for each patient.

Statistics and Reporting: Administrators have access to statistics and reporting features. They can view reports in tabular and chart formats using the Chart.js library, such as monthly revenue and appointment frequency, as well as medication usage.

Customizable Rules: Administrators have the ability to modify certain rules, such as the maximum number of patients per day and consultation fees. They can also manage the list of medications, including adding, deleting, editing, and searching for different types of medications and units of measurement.
